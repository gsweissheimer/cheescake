<p>The challenge proposed was an application that shows some news to the users, allows them to filter by preferences and a login service.</p>
<p>The application was developed using REACT JS to render the responsive frontend and NODE JS  as an REST API to provide some information</p>
<p>In order to dynamically load the news, using the newsAPI - http://newsapi.org/ - I had to randomically set a category to each news before saving them in the database as you can see on the cron.js file inside the service directory.</p>
<p>I have made this to complete one extra task without changing the specs.</p>
<p>I'm very glad with the opportunity to make this challenge and expect to hear from you soon.</p>

<br /><br />Thank you for your appreciation!
